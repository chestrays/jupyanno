# jupyanno 

A simple set of jupyter-based tools for quickly annotating images using IPython widgets. The toolkit is made to be easily extensible and suggestions / improvements are welcome.

# Chest X-Ray Task

Here we have a demo chest X-Ray task where the annotation and viewing of a sample dataset can be done entirely with these tools.
